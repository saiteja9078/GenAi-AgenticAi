# 🧠 Generative AI Learning Notebooks

Welcome to my **Generative AI (GenAI)** learning repository! This collection of Jupyter notebooks documents my journey through various topics and techniques in GenAI, including models that generate text, images, and more. The goal of this repository is to serve both as my personal learning archive and as a resource for others interested in this field.

## 📚 Topics Covered

This repository will be continuously updated as I explore more concepts. Current topics include:

- Fine-tuning Transformers like Text Generation with Language Models (google/pegasus model).
- Vector Databases (Chroma,pinecone).
- Langchain prompt templates using gemini api.
- Chat Memory
